### Why:

Technical and non-technical barriers to effective collaboration often
hamper progress, especially when highly productive groups with diverse
expertise and computational backgrounds work on common problems.
Overcoming these barriers and learning from collective experience is
critical for ensuring successful outcomes.

### What:

This two-part workshop will be conducted in an idea/innovation labs
format with meeting facilitators.  The goal is to bring together
thought-leaders and practitioners in data-driven open science projects
with participants from areas emphasizing Astronomy, Earth Sciences,
Computational and Information Sciences, Mathematics, and
Cyberinfrastructure.

We've dubbed the two workshops "Lemon" and "Lemonade" labs.  During
the Lemon Lab, we will openly discuss challenges in inter- and
transdisciplinary collaborations and brainstorm ideas on improve
productivity and outcomes.  At the subsequent Lemonade Lab (Fall
2019), participants will prototype ideas and solutions identified
during the Lemon Lab workshop in a codefest/hackathon-style event â€”
turning "lemons" into thirst-quenching "lemonade."

### Who, When & Where:

May 13-16, 2019, held at [Biosphere 2](http://biosphere2.org) (north
of Tucson, AZ).  Participants are requested to arrive on May 12 and
may depart on May 16 morning.  To ensure the best outcome, we are
inviting a maximum of 25-30 participants for the Lemon Lab.

### Perks of the Lemon/ade Labs:

- Travel expenses will be covered by reimbursements from the award.
- Learn best practices from subject matter experts for sharing data,
  code, models and obtain access to large-scale computing systems
  (CPU/GPU) at no cost for your TRIPODS project.
- Learn how different disciplines are making effective use of "Big
  Data" tools like Apache Spark, Storm, Kafka etc. and ML platforms
  TensorFlow, MLflow etc.
- Learn techniques for sharing reproducible analyses with
  collaborators.
- Learn how to establish a Commons for sharing products from your
  research projects, teams and TRIPODS center.
- Contribute to writing a best practices document inspired by popular
  ["10 simple rules" PLoS
  Collection](https://collections.plos.org/ten-simple-rules), i.e.,
  "10 Simple Rules for Productive Data Science Collaborations".
- Enjoy the tranquil, historic environment of Biosphere2 as the
  events' backdrop, with a behind-the-scenes tour by one of its
  scientists.
- Be part of a welcoming community of collaborators with experience in
  developing data science based tools, technologies and
  community-adopted resources.
